      <ol class="Instructions">
         <li>Place the slice of bread into your toaster.
            <p>(optional: most toasters are able to cook two slices of bread simultaneously. If desired, place two slices into your toaster at this time)</p>

            <p>(chef's note: most toasters will notify you when the toast is complete. Go and get some chores done while you're toast is being made!)</p>

         <li>Remove toast from the toaster, serve, and enjoy!
            <p>(optional: add butter to your toast for an exciting new dimension of flavor and texture!)</p>
